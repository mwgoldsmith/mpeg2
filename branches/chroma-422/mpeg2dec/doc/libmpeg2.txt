Basic Usage Pseudocode
----------------------

        if (you need a certain acceleration)
                mpeg2_accel(desired_acceleration);
        handle=mpeg2_init();
        info=mpeg2_info(handle);
        while (data_available) {
                state=mpeg2_parse(handle);
                switch (state) {
                case STATE_BUFFER:
                        read some data
                        mpeg2_buffer(handle,data_start,data_end);
                        break;
                case STATE_SLICE:
                case STATE_END:
                        display the frame described in "info"
                        break;
                case STATE_INVALID:
                        abort
                        break;
                }
        }
        mpeg2_close(handle);


Basic Usage Explained
---------------------

libmpeg2 uses an opaque pointer which is the active "handle" to the mpeg2
decoder.  To get this handle (of type "mpeg2dec_t"), call "mpeg2_init()".

Data is loaded into the decoder with "mpeg2_buffer" whenever
"mpeg2_parse" is ready for more data (return state is STATE_BUFFER).
Pictures are available whenever "mpeg2_parse"'s return state is
STATE_SLICE or STATE_END.

        This means the *previous* picture is available, right?  In other
        words, when STATE_SLICE is seen, that means that the *previous*
        picture is all done.  Same thing for STATE_END.  So if you want to
        see one frame at a time (without starting to fill the mpeg2 decoder
        with more data not from that picture) we'd have to inject something
        to make it report STATE_END?



Basic Function Reference
------------------------

mpeg2dec_t * mpeg2_init()
        Initializes a memory space for mpeg2 decoding.  This memory must
        be freed with a call to "mpeg2_close" when finished.

        Returns NULL on error (when system is out of memory)

                - Doesn't check if chunk_buffer is NULL?


uint32_t mpeg2_accel(uint32_t accel)
        Sets the CPU acceleration type to be used for all decoders for the
        life of the program.  YOU CAN SAFELY IGNORE THIS FUNCTION.
       
        By default, a call to mpeg2_accel is not needed, since the best
        available acceleration will be auto-detected.  To override the
        default, this function must be called before any calls to
        "mpeg2_init".  See mpeg2.h for a list of the available accelerations
        (prefix "MPEG2_ACCEL_...").
        
        After a call to mpeg2_init, mpeg2_accel can be called to find out
        what the selected acceleration list is.  Once the accelerations have
        been selected (through explicitly requesting one, or through
        auto-detection) the "accel" parameter will be ignored.

        Returns selected acceleration list.  If the requested acceleration
        is not available, the function will auto-detect the best available
        accelerations and return that instead.
        
                - Cannot be undone!  This should maybe be a part of
                  the mpeg2 structure somehow?


const mpeg2_info_t * mpeg2_info(mpeg2dec_t * handle)
        Gets structure for the mpeg2 decoder's "mpeg2_info_t" structure.
        This will let you do something (like display!) the decoded pictures
        with the mpeg2_info_t structure members:

        display_fbuf:
                memory area containing the rendered picture information.
                If this is NULL, no frame is available.

        display_fbuf->buf:
                YUV coded pixel data for the picture.

        display_picture:
                data structure describing the current picture.
                see mpeg2.h for more details.

        sequence:
                data structure describing the entire current picture sequence:

                width:  picture width in pixels.
                height: picture height in pixels.

                see mpeg2.h for more details.

        user_data:
                handy place to attach things needed by your program.  Must
                be detached before calling "mpeg2_close".

        there are more...check mpeg2.h




int mpeg2_parse(mpeg2dec_t * handle)
        Parses available data and returns state of the decoder:

        STATE_BUFFER:
                ready for more data.  decoder has finished reading
                the buffer sent with mpeg2_buffer.

        STATE_SEQUENCE:
                A sequence header has been found.

        STATE_SEQUENCE_REPEATED:
                A repeated sequence header has been found and processed.

        STATE_GOP:
                A GOP has been found.

        STATE_PICTURE:
                A picture header has been found.
        STATE_PICTURE_2ND:
                A second field picture header has been found.

        STATE_SLICE_1ST:
                First slice of a multi-field picture has been found.
        STATE_SLICE:
                Final slice (multi-field or not) of a picture has been found.
                Good time to update the display.
        STATE_END:
                End of the stream?  Good time to update the display.

        STATE_INVALID:
                Filled the internal buffers without finding any start codes.
                Cannot continue: mpeg2_close must be called next.


void mpeg2_buffer(mpeg2dec_t * handle, uint8_t * start, uint8_t * end)
        Makes data between "start" and "end" available for processing.
        If a subsequent call to "mpeg2_parse" doesn't find anything useful
        (returns STATE_BUFFER) then this data will be copied into the mpeg2
        decoder's private data area.  This process repeats until something
        useful is found with mpeg2_parse (returns something other than
        STATE_BUFFER), or the buffer fills up.


void mpeg2_close(mpeg2dec_t * handle)
        Cleans up the memory associated with the mpeg2 decoder handle.

        - does not check for NULL frees! (via mpeg2_free)
